Reqs

So what I understand:

1. Research if JSON formats are different for diff types of graphs

2. Do a protoype , with 3 diff views ... based on Customer , Store, product and sales

 sale, store, customer, product, value, date


Components:

JsonParser --> chartvar --> sidebar --> render sidebar 













Steps:

Step 1: Research JSON Formats for Different Types of Graphs

Research various JSON formats commonly used for representing graph data.
Understand the structure of JSON data for different types of graphs, such as bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, etc.
Identify key components required to represent data for customer, store, product, and sales.
Step 2: Design the JSON Data Structure

Based on the research, design a JSON data structure that can represent the sales data for customers, stores, products, and sales transactions.
Define the properties and nested structures required to store the relevant information for each entity.
Step 3: Create a Prototype

Set up a development environment for the prototype.
Implement a basic web application or user interface (UI) for data input and visualization.
Create sample JSON data for different sales transactions involving customers, stores, products, and sales values for specific dates.
Step 4: Make a Sidebar Component

Design and implement a sidebar component in the prototype.
The sidebar should allow users to select the view they want to visualize, such as customer, store, product, or sales data.
When the user selects a view, the corresponding data should be fetched and prepared for visualization.
Step 5: Make a Graph Component

Design and implement a graph component in the prototype.
The graph component should be capable of displaying various types of graphs (e.g., bar graph, line graph, pie chart) based on the selected view from the sidebar.
Bind the JSON data from the selected view to the graph component for visualization.
Step 6: Integrate Sidebar and Graph Components

Connect the sidebar component to the graph component in the prototype.
Ensure that when the user selects a particular view from the sidebar, the corresponding graph is displayed in the graph component.
Step 7: Test and Debug

Test the prototype thoroughly to ensure that it handles different scenarios and edge cases.
Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.
Step 8: Improve User Interface (Optional)

Enhance the user interface to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
Implement features such as tooltips, legends, and labels to improve the readability of the graphs.
Step 9: Data Validation and Error Handling

Implement data validation to ensure that the JSON data provided by the user is in the correct format and structure.
Add error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid data or unexpected errors.
Step 10: Documentation and Deployment

Document the entire project, including the JSON data structure, codebase, and how to use the application.
If applicable, deploy the prototype to a web server or hosting platform for testing and demonstration purposes.
